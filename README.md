## Context: HitlerHax was/is a client which was started by the Imps, named ImpHack, then renamed by MaxRockatasky to Anti-ImpHack, and then eventually to HitlerHax. He had asked me to help him with the client, and had invited me to the repository. The first thing I had done was re-wrote the ENTIRE README.md. Shortly after I began working with Max, I had noticed the skid, and ego in him come out, and promptly took it up with him directly. To which he promptly kicked me from the repo, like a child. So... without further ado, I give you the official HitlerHax Leak 2.

## This version of HitlerHax was sent to me by my pal NotRockysAly#6534 | UserID: 925299365906632754, so give him all the credit, as I wouldn't be releasing this w/o him. (P.S., he left hs_err_pid & replay_pid) dumps within his upload, such a script kiddie.
